            <h2>General Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Players alternate turns, drawing one card per turn and managing resources to play cards.</li>
                <li>Cards are divided into three types: Creatures, Spells, and Traps.</li>
                <li>The goal is to reduce your opponent's life points to zero before they can do the same to you.</li>
                <li>Players can only play cards if they have enough resources (mana, energy, etc.) as required by the card's cost.</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 1: Set Up</h3>
                    <p>Each player shuffles their deck and draws five cards to form their starting hand. Decide who goes first by flipping a coin or rolling a die.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Your Turn</h3>
                    <p>At the beginning of your turn, draw one card from your deck. You can now play cards, summon creatures, or use spells based on your available resources.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3: Battle</h3>
                    <p>Attack your opponent’s life points or their creatures on the field. Each creature has an attack and defense value. Strategize carefully to outmaneuver your opponent!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 4: End Turn</h3>
                    <p>After playing your cards, it's time to end your turn. Your opponent now draws a card and starts their turn. The game continues until one player's life points are reduced to zero.</p>

**Card Chronicles** - A game created by three passionate friends over the course of a month with lots of sleepless weekends and working nights.

## Inspiration
The main inspiration for the game was trading cards which is a huge attraction for little children. The genre we picked for the backstory of the game was a fantasy - inspired by many folklore stories and characters from Middle Earth.

## What it does
The Card Chronicles is a game that tries to emulate the card battle that children often how with their trading cards. For entertainment of a single player it also supports a play VS AI mode that allows a battle with AI.

## How we built it
We build the frontend of the game using HTML5, put the designs using CSS3 and the backend programming was done using JavaScript. Finally for hosting the site we use the GitHub.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into several technical bugs , But we were able to overcome them through working together and finding innovative solutions. Some of the major problems that we had to overcome was to organize and put the content in a comprehensible and immersive manner to the audience. Another problem  was to find the age appropriate resource material for the targeted audience and being able to engage them while still being aligned to our ideas.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of being able to complete (a portion :) of ) the game , and being able to use our skills to create a game that can engage children of age 5-11. The game features 20 unique selectable characters and a play against AI feature that we were able to implement.

## What we learned
We learned a lot how to work together on a project, collaborate on a team project and deliver the product before deadline. Technically we learnt to host our own working web-game on a online platform successfully, along with learning new things about our Tech-Stack of HTML5, CSS3, And JavaScript.
## What's next for Card Chronicles
Next up we plan to create a currency system , an online leaderboard system, a multiple player mode-Arena mode along with providing visual updates regularly.

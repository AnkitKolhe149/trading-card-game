            <p class="character-description">
                “With a spear in hand and the wind at his back, he strikes with the precision of a striking falcon.”

                Dorin Windwalker, known as The Swift Pike, is a master spearman whose agility and finesse make him a formidable force on the battlefield. Clad in light armor that allows for maximum mobility, he wields a finely crafted spear, Skypiercer, which he throws with deadly accuracy or uses to engage foes in close combat. His movements are fluid and graceful, resembling a dancer as he weaves through opponents, striking before they even realize he’s there.
                
                Trained in the ancient arts of polearm combat, Dorin excels at both offense and defense, able to hold the line against charging enemies or strike from a distance with lethal precision. His keen instincts and tactical mind enable him to read the flow of battle, making split-second decisions that often turn the tide in his favor. A wanderer at heart, Dorin travels Eldrath, seeking to refine his skills and test himself against the greatest warriors. With a spirit as free as the wind, he embodies the harmony of strength and grace, forever ready to defend those in need with his swift, unerring strikes.            </p>

            <p class="character-description">
                “With the strength of a roaring avalanche and the fury of a wild storm, he shatters all who stand in his path.”

                Kael Stormbreaker is a towering force of nature, a barbarian whose raw power and untamed spirit have earned him the title of The Raging Mountain. Wielding the Colossus Axe, an enormous weapon forged from the bones of a slain giant and etched with ancient runes of fury, Kael charges into battle like a living tempest. His muscled frame is scarred from countless battles, each mark a testament to his survival against impossible odds. With every swing, the ground trembles and enemies are sent sprawling, crushed beneath his relentless onslaught. Clad in armor fashioned from dragon scales and the hides of mythical beasts, he fears neither man nor monster. His war cry echoes through the battlefield, a deafening roar that instills fear in his enemies and ignites the ferocity of his allies. Unyielding, unstoppable, Kael is a berserker unleashed, a living legend who leaves only ruins in his wake.            </p>
